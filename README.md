# Wildlife Reserve Simulation

## Project Overview

This Java-based project simulates a wildlife reserve ecosystem using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The simulation models various animals, their behaviors, and interactions within a virtual wildlife reserve environment.

## Features

- Diverse animal species with unique characteristics
- Simulated ecosystem interactions (e.g., predator-prey relationships)
- Environmental factors affecting animal behavior
- Population dynamics and growth patterns

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or VS Code

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Build the project to resolve dependencies.

## Usage

To run the simulation:

1. Navigate to the main class file (e.g., `WildlifeReserveSimulation.java`).
2. Run the main method to start the simulation.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts or modify simulation parameters as needed.
